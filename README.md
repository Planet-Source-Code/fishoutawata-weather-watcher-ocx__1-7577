## Weather Watcher OCX

### Description

Placing this control on a form will allow you to retrieve current weather conditions for any city in the United States.. Based on my Weather Watch Program I submitted yesterday. You can contact me on AOL Instant Messanger, my username is Itchiban J
 
### More Info
 
You must have MSXML.dll ver 2.0 If you have the newest version of IE5 then you should have no problems. I've included a Readme.txt file that gives an example of using the control.

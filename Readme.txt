Thank you for downloading my Weather Watcher OCX.  


To Use:

1.  Set the city and state properties of the WeatherWatcher OCX
2.  Call the Connect Method 
3.  Read values passed back from OCX.

Example:

WeatherWatcher1.City = "Bakersfield"
WeatherWatcher1.State = "Ca"
WeatherWatcher1.Connect


text1.text = WeatherWatcher1.Temperature
text2.text = WeatherWatcher1.WindSpeed

etc.........


Thanks again and enjoy
